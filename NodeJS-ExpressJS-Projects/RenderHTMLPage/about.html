        <h2>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
        <p>Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with
            Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web
            applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.</p>

        <p>The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server, meaning that it is
            relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of popular
            development stacks like the MEAN, MERN or MEVN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and a
            JavaScript front-end framework or library.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Express.js was founded by TJ Holowaychuk. The first release, according to Express.js's GitHub repository,
            was on 22 May 2010. Version 0.12</p>

        <p>In June 2014, rights to manage the project were acquired by StrongLoop. StrongLoop was acquired by IBM in
            September 2015; in January 2016, IBM announced that it would place Express.js under the stewardship of
            the Node.js Foundation incubator.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ol>Robust routing</ol>
        <ol>Concentrate on high-performance</ol>
        <ol>HTTP helpers (redirection, caching, etc)</ol>
        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>Express.js is used by Fox Sports, PayPal, Uber and IBM.</p>
